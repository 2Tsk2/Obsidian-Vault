<h4>Simple Interest (Gumagana pareho) :</h4> 
$Is=P\cdot R \cdot T$  
$Is=P ( 1 + rt)$
Ex: 
 **Given:**
 P = 15,000 
 R = 10% ( Always convert % to decimal {2 places}) | 10% -> 0.10 | )
 T = 2 ( If the value is in months, divide T by 12 )
 Is=? 

 $Is=15,000 \cdot 0.10 \cdot 2$ 
 $Is= 15,000 \cdot 0.2$
 $Is=3,000$ 

 Final answer : 3000 pesos in 2 years
<h5>Principal :</h5>
$P = \frac{I}{R \cdot T }$ 
Ex:
 **Given:**
 P = ?
 R = 10% ( Always convert % to decimal {2 places}) | 10% -> 0.10 | )
 T = 2 ( If the value is in months, divide T by 12 )
 I = 3,000

 $P = \frac{3,000}{0.10 \cdot 2 }$ 
 
 $P = \frac{3,000}{0.2}$ 

 $P = 15,000$ 

 Final answer: P = 15,000 pesos
<h5>Rate :</h5>
$R = \frac{I}{P \cdot T }$
Ex:
 **Given:**
 P = 15,000 
 R = ? (always multiply final answer by 100 to convert from decimal to %)
 T = 2 ( If the value is in months, divide T by 12 )
 L = 3,000
<h5>Time :</h5>
$T = \frac{I}{P \cdot R }$
Ex:
 **Given:**
 P = 15,000 
 R = 10% ( Always convert % to decimal {2 places}) | 10% -> 0.10 | )
 T = ?
 L =3,000
